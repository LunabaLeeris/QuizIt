# QuizIt
A Java-swing quiz maker application. 

# Background

 This application was made as a project of mine back when I was 1st year (1st term) at National-Univerity
 
# Description

 It is an application that creates a quiz for you. All you have to do is input a defition-answer pair. 
 
 You can also configure the quiz you want (multiple-choice, identification, fill in the blanks etc.) (timed or not). 
 
 The quizes are also saved in your device for future purposes!. 
 
 The code wasn't maintained as I did this in a rush -_-#

# Future additions

 If time will permit, I will add a way to share your quiz to other quiz-it users through links.
